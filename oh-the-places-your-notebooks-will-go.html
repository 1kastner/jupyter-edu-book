<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Oh the places your notebooks will go!</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In chapter 4 you will learn about the many creative ways that notebooks can be
used within the design of your course. Many times notebooks can be adapted into
course activities that you are already doing, and other times notebooks will
give you opportunities to extend what you have done in past to increase the
engagement, participation, understanding, and performance of your students.
Jupyter Notebooks can be a valuable member of your existing instruction toolkit,
useful at every point in the learning environment. New adopters of Jupyter can
start small, incorporating notebooks into single modules, assignments, or
classroom activities. This is an excellent approach to see how your learning
audience interacts with the notebook environment and explore notebook hosting
systems in a low cost/risk way.</p>
<p>Instructors adopt Jupyter within their classrooms at a variety of levels, each
making use of the strong features of the environment. Transitioning an existing
course to any new platform seems daunting, but Jupyter notebooks are modular and
ideal for an iterative development approach of adoption. Some may find
themselves inheriting a course already built in Jupyter, while others will
choose to build new courses entirely within Jupyter.</p>
<p>This section seeks to inspire you about the many uses of Jupyter within
classroom content and presentation design, and preview how other elements of the
Jupyter ecosystem can be integrated into that use. Some of these uses are quick
to spin up as experiments to test the waters.</p>
</div>
<div id="jupyter-notebooks-as-textbooks" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Jupyter Notebooks as textbooks</h2>
<p>Instructors often write Jupyter Notebooks as linear narrative documents. These
notebooks are to be read by students and learners, perhaps worked through,
marked up and are a relatively one sided information consumption experience.</p>
<p>Most often these notebooks exist as the readings a learner is required to do
before class, as reference material (e.g., to review for future assessments), or
something that a learner works through on their own as a part of self study.
Jupyter notebooks can be constructed of completely static text, which can serve
as a starting point for transitioning existing material into the notebook
environment.</p>
<p>This traditional static textbook chapter or section can be extended into an
active space by changing inline code text to executable code cells that support
modification and experimentation. Adding prompts with suggestions for
interrogating the code and examples further extend active learning opportunities
without rewriting the original content. Interactive sliders, user input sources,
and manipulable visualizations are examples of how other widgets and plugins can
open up more possibilities.</p>
<p>As you’ll see in later chapters, many authors are using Jupyter notebooks as
their primary authoring and publishing platforms. These materials are published
on paper and online, meaning that the interactive portions of the learning
experience are first class elements within the resource.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-workbooksprimer" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Notebooks as workbooks/primer</h2>
<p>Workbooks engage students in the notebook environment by including active
elements where they are asked to manipulate or create new content. This moves
students from a passive or static learning environment like a book into an
active learning experience where they can engage with and critically think about
the content.</p>
<p>You can include many pedagogical patterns (discussed in the next chapter) within
a workbook, crafting a completely custom learning experience. These workbooks
can be assigned as independent student learning (for example, pre-work for
flipped classroom), or as part of an in class activity for individuals or small
groups.</p>
<p>When teaching in the technical space, the exploration of concepts in their
context is an ideal environment for showcasing an authentic experience to
students. Studying a concept in isolation may reduce the complexity of the
problem to be more accessible, but this removes it from the context for why it
exists and may make it harder for students to put all the pieces together and
synthesize it into their larger problem solving repertoire.</p>
<p>Retention of this context adds the complexity of expository text, technical
reference in disconnected documents, or some boilerplate code. Providing this in
a large script or lengthy lists of direction can be overwhelming for students to
work with. Jupyter notebooks are excellent tools for teaching these complex
workflows, because instead of a script with lengthy code comments or having
disconnected documentation, this guiding text can be embedded exactly where it
is needed where the coding is happening. This guidance material can also be
formatted as markdown cells, which are visually distinct from code, making it
easier to visually scan and opens the possibility to add helpful formatting.</p>
<p>A variety of activities can be supported with the executable code cells so
learners can explore the space in an interactive and iterative environment.
They can see and inspect portions of the surrounding code, but aren’t required
to touch it, maintaining appropriate granularity for assignments and challenges.
Using markdown formatting separating sections helps scaffold larger problems and
help them really experience a real world workflow rather than statically read
about it.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-worksheetsdrill-sets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Notebooks as worksheets/drill sets</h2>
<p>Many programming and domain tasks have specific syntaxes to be learned and
effectively memorized before they can be internalized. Akin to math homework
sheets, short worksheets where learners focus on highly granular or
decontextualized problem sets lets them practice the complex syntax and
procedures in an isolated and highly focused way. A set of small targeted tasks
where these complexities can be practiced without the worry of additional syntax
errors or other problem solving requirements can reduce the cognitive overhead a
student might be overwhelmed by.</p>
<p>The cell based nature of the Jupyter notebook makes interactive code-based
worksheets a clean experience for students to run. Each problem prompt can be
written in a markdown cell, perhaps referencing an object or data file
established in an initial cell. For example, a list or other data structure
would be defined at the top and the exercises below are focused on the relevant
methods and usage syntax. Each answer would then be completed by the student in
a single code cell just below that markdown cell. This means that outputs and
errors stay with the code producing them, so successes or bugs are easily
traceable to the source.</p>
<p>Usages of autograding tools or unit tests, as discussed in later chapters, can
be added to give students instant feedback about their work. Example or desired
outputs could also be reproduced in markdown cells with the question for further
guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-notepaper-or-course-packets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Notebooks as notepaper or course packets</h2>
<p>The ability for a notebook to represent a linear experience with human prose and
working code means that these can be used a student’s notepaper in class. They
can capture the linear narrative structure of a lesson or lecture, and actually
run the code they are taking note of. This ensures that what they have written
down actually works, and makes for a strongly reusable document for them moving
forward with homework.</p>
<p>Encouraging students to use Jupyter notebooks for taking class notes opens up
further opportunities to provide scaffolding and support within the classroom.
Providing notebooks with outlines of lecture content or other materials covered
in class can become an useful active learning and engagement strategy. You might
provide a mostly blank notebook with just topic headings, and ask them to take
notes in their own style within those spaces. Or you could choose to embed
reference notes, examples, and even small activities within the notebook, asking
them to both take notes and work through examples with you.</p>
<p>Caution should be taken to encourage students to carefully maintain a linear
order of their code in the notebooks. A later chapter has more information on
Jupyter specific caveats that students should remain aware of.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-an-app" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Notebooks as an app</h2>
<p>Notebooks even have a place in non-coding classroom content or activity.
Interactive user inputs like mouse or touchscreen controlled sliders, buttons,
highlighting, etc. allow a notebook user to manipulate input parameters for a
visualization, tool, or model without directly editing any of the code within
the notebook. These strategies support interactive computational exploration, or
transform the notebook into an advanced calculator tool for students to use
within their homework. These notebooks are then treated as applications that are
distributed or made available for students to use during class or explore on
their own.</p>
<p>This allows you to make an existing research workflow accessible to novice
students as part of a computational module of a foundational class, or mock up
content from a static textbook or reading into something for an active learning
activity. The adaptability and reuse aspects of Jupyter notebooks also create
opportunities for students to take this code further and adapt it for
assignments or other research.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-lab-reports-or-assignments" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Notebooks as lab reports or assignments</h2>
<p>There are a variety of assignment deliverables that programming and technical
courses may require. Students may be asked to produce essays, presentations,
working code, analytics, and even art or music. Many of these deliverables are
directly supported within the notebook environment. Any written work could be
completed within the notebook environment with markdown, which is ideal for
communication content that is driven by data or incorporating code content. For
example, a student could write a computational essay within a notebook, and use
one of the presentation tools to present a report out in class, all using the
same notebook.</p>
<p>Coding assignments can be submitted to a Jupyter supported learning management
system and be autograded (discussed in later chapters), providing instant
feedback and automating the grading process. This opens up self paced and
highly scaled options for many courses, particularly open access MOOCs or large
sections. Meanwhile, the inline visualization options mean that as assignment
with graphical output can be self contained without trying to embed images
within a word processing document or attaching a collection of images along with
a script.</p>
<p>The multiple conversion and hosting options available to notebooks means that
they can be shared or submitted across many formats. For example, conversion to
HTML means that there is zero overhead for viewing the content, and support for
markdown and PDF opens up accessibility and other publishing platforms.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-interactive-multimedia-platforms" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Notebooks as interactive multimedia platforms</h2>
<p>A variety of media formats can be embedded within a notebook, and other tools
more offer platforms to more directly connect notebooks with multimedia content.
Instruction content might be split up between short videos (often for flipped
classrooms) or a variety of static images might be important for an assignment.
The markdown cells within the Jupyter notebook provide several ways to place
hyperlinks and embed a variety of media.</p>
<p>Several widgets are also available for embedding playable audio and video
content (including from streaming video services) directly within the notebook.
This creates a cohesive platform experience for the student, so they don’t have
to exit out or change screens to work on their assignment and reference that
content.</p>
<p>Other tools are available for more directly connecting the notebook content to a
video guide. Video lectures or content in your courses can get lengthy in
running time and associated notebooks are often just as long. Tools like Oriole
(<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/</a>)
provide a platform where you can integrate video timestamps into notebooks to
create interactive video experiences. You can include, for example, Youtube
videos within notebooks, with text and/or coding opportunities before/after the
video. Using timecodes, you can also guide students through the videos in
tandem with the notebook text. This further extends the ability to create a
single cohesive interactive experience without the need for students to go back
and forth between materials.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-a-demonstration-platform" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Notebooks as a demonstration platform</h2>
<p>Eventually you will have to display a notebook in class. This may be as a
demonstration of how to use a notebook, presenting more a traditional style
lecture, creating and editing code, or using an interactive feature to explore
an experiment. Normal standards for font sizes, organization, and accessibility
stand for these cases.</p>
<p>Displaying actual notebook within your presentation is a natural starting point.
This content may include text from markdown and LaTeX, code, and independent
figures and sketches. For instance the lecturer could display the notebook,
slowly scrolling through the material and interacting with cells containing code
while also making use of either a digital or analog (e.g. chalkboard) sketching
device. Custom styling plugins are available to change the background color,
font, and other viewing aspects of the notebook for better presentation quality
and accessibility.</p>
<p>Several slide show tools are available, which allow you to markup notebook cell
content for a more traditional slideshow presentation mode without having to
exit from your standard notebook. These slides can be scattered across notebook
content into specific cells that will correspond to individual slides, with the
other content ignored from the presentation. This then can be shown alongside
the usual notebook interface and can be flipped between the other forms of
content.</p>
<p>It is natural for students to read and interact with notebooks in their standard
form, using either Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and this can also be used for
presentation. Jupyter Lab offers the convenience and uniformity of being able to
open and edit source files (.py, etc.) within the same environment and without
OS- or browser-specific clutter. Full screening the browser is recommended if
presenting using this mode. Presentation styles vary widely and span a spectrum
from full-prepared notebooks to blank-slate live coding.</p>
<p>Many find it useful to incorporate an alternate modality such as a physical or
digital “board” for free-form diagramming, working through a mathematical
derivation, or other written procedural task. Notebooks can be a portion of
these presentations or the complete environment, depending on your personal
instruction style and content needs.</p>
<p>Care should be taken about how the notebook is presented and demonstrated. Doing
a live demo gives you a few options. You might choose to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll through a notebook</li>
<li>Step through a notebook by executing the cells in order</li>
<li>Fill out details or values into a mostly complete notebook</li>
<li>Tweak or flesh out a notebook with some content</li>
<li>Add content to a completely blank notebook</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these strategies have a place within a classroom, and their use should
be informed by audience needs and learning goals. For example, having a notebook
with prepared challenges for the end of each module or section, but with blank
cells for the content gives you the opportunity to develop code live within
class, but within a structure that keeps your workflow organized, and your
formative assessments coded directly into your presentation. Incorporating
reference information can make these documents more complete for students and
answer common questions. There are many possibilities about what you can put in.
Keep in mind that students will often ask for you to share copies of these
notebooks after the class session is completed.</p>
<p>How much you focus on live coding will likely be determined by the domain
content of the class. Programming courses would clearly have a priority for
students to have more thorough practice with writing and typing in the code.
However, a conceptual class looking at computational models may interactively
tweak parameters for a model and discuss only what is happening within that
mathematical model. No code is written or directly changed in the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="notebooks-as-a-live-coding-environment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Notebooks as a live coding environment</h2>
<p>Live coding, as the name implies, involves the active writing of code within the
instruction process. This might be part of a recorded screencast or an in person
classroom. The process of live coding has several benefits for the student and
instructor.</p>
<p>Showing the process of building up code examples showcases the natural
non-linear process of how code is crafted, but walking through the logic of a
code example slows instruction down and highlights the reason for inclusion of
each element within the code.</p>
<p>Introduction of bugs (either purposeful or accidental) to the code has the added
benefit of giving the presenter an opportunity to work through the debugging
process and demonstrating that perfect code is never created on the first go.</p>
<p>Live-coding can also be an opportunity to provide an active learning experience
by providing notebooks with code that has not been completed before the lecture
and having students attempt to fill in the missing lines before doing the
live-coding demonstration. Feedback on where students are in this process can
be a useful way to also judge what students are retaining and are struggling
with leading to just-in-time teaching opportunities.</p>
<p>Formative assessment and prediction prompts can also be incorporated either
directly into the notebook or as part of the narration of the lecture. Creating
live-coding opportunities can be done anytime where a block of code exists but
picking out particularly illustrative examples or key points and appropriately
scaffolding the example can be critical. For example, if the critical concept
is inside of a for loop then only coding the inner part of the for loop can be
helpful and not overwhelm the presentation with scaffolding such as the setup.
The reverse can also be true however. If the complexity or amount of
scaffolding is displayed learners may struggle to understand the scaffolding
rather than concentrating on the key concept.</p>
<p>Many instructors utilizing live coding will choose to have students code along
with them. This allows them to practice what they are learning, see it in the
natural context of their environment, make all the normal mistakes and typos,
and all within an environment where they can ask questions (or pause a video).
Actively coding along with the instructor also includes a requirement that they
are actively listening to the instructor and engaged with the content.</p>
<p>Presentation styles of scrolling or shift + enter can are not live coding, but
live demonstrations. While these limit or negate the benefits of the live
coding environment, the benefits of speeding up the presentation or running
through code that’s irrelevant to the learning goals may be more important.
Removing the student’s active engagement with the content may eventually lead to
their disengagement with the lesson, or missing large chunks of information.
Instructors should balance their inclusion of live coding and live demonstration
to ensure that students are active and engaged with the most important aspects
of the lesson.</p>
<p>Information bandwidth in the classroom during a live coding session needs to be
carefully managed, particularly when students are trying follow along. The
rhythm of live coding roughly has three stages: preparation, typing, and
explanation. These three follow quickly in succession but are independent
phases. Preparation is the first, where you stop and explain what you are about
to do. Typing is the next phase where you should speak as you type but only say
what you are typing. This ensures that what the learners are seeing on the
screen and hearing from you match. They will likely be looking back and forth
between their screen and yours that they often won’t be able to stop and follow
what you are saying while they are typing. The final stage is to stop and
explain what you have typed and what has or will happen when you run the code.
You may choose to execute the code and explain the results or include a
formative assessment or prediction question before running the code. Pausing to
explain the code you just wrote and walk through the results gives students time
to catch up to your typing, time to consider what has happened, and a natural
place to ask (and for you to as for) questions about what has happened.</p>
<p>Live coding does take practice to get used to, but can be extremely powerful for
you to restrain your pace to your learners and to retain engagement with your
students.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.11</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>As you have just seen, notebooks provide a flexible tool that can be used in
numerous ways to achieve your course goals. Notebooks are flexible enough that
you can use them from relatively passive to very active student learning, you
can use them in your lecture or in a flipped-classroom environment. There is no
single best way to use notebooks in your courses, and you explore the various
options you will want to start filling your use of notebooks with a variety of
the pedagogical patterns described in next chapter.</p>
