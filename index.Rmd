# Introduction {#intro}

This handbook is for any educator teaching a topic that includes data analysis or computation
to support the learning—not just courses in engineering or science, but also data journalism,
business and quantitative economics, data-based decision sciences and policy,
quantitative health sciences, and digital humanities. It aims to give an entry point, and
a broad overview of Jupyter in education. Whether you are already using Jupyter to teach,
you have found learning materials built on Jupyter that piqued your curiosity,
or have never heard of Jupyter, the material in this open book can help you empower
your teaching with this new technology.

[Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is a broad collaboration that develops open-source
tools for interactive and exploratory computing. The tools include: IPython,
the Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Hub, and an ecosystem of extensions contributed by a large community.
Jupyter Notebook exploded in popularity since late 2014, fueled by its adoption as the
favorite environment for doing data science. It has also grown as a platform to use
in the classroom, to develop teaching materials, to share lessons and tutorials, and more.
Notebooks are documents containing text narratives, combined with executable code
(many languages are supported) and the output of that code. This marriage of content and
code makes for a powerful new form of data-based communication. Educators everywhere are
adopting Jupyter for teaching.

Educators newly adopting Jupyter can be overwhelmed by having to navigate the
ecosystem of tools and content. They could study many examples, or consume myriad
blog posts and talk videos to distill the patterns of good practices and
technical solutions to best serve their students. Several early adopters,
having much experience to share, decided to begin collecting this know-how,
and sharing open documentation about using Jupyter for teaching and learning.
The result is this open book: a live document of collective experience with Jupyter in education.

The Jupyter Community Workshop in Washington, DC (November 2018) began that process, with a
book sprint aimed at producing the first version of this handbook. The collaboratively
written book consolidates explanations and examples covering key topics, including:
what is Jupyter, how to try Jupyter, sharing notebooks with students, locally installing Jupyter,
cloud offerings, finding example notebooks, writing lessons in Jupyter,
making collections for a course, exporting to other formats with nbconvert,
writing textbooks with Jupyter, using Binder, JupyterHub, making assignments and auto-grading,
making online courses, teaching with Jupyter in the classroom, active learning and
flipped learning pedagogies with Jupyter, guiding learners to create their own content in Jupyter,
and more. This open handbook will grow to encompass all you need to know about Jupyter in
teaching and learning.

If you find these materials helpful or inspiring, give us a shout-out on Twitter
using `#Jupyter4Edu`. We hope you do!


## Acknowledgments {-}

The book sprint was held at the George Washington University in Washington, DC,
on 28–30 November 2018, and organized by Lorena A. Barba. Funding to support the
logistics and travel of all [participants](#authors) was possible thanks to a grant
from Bloomberg to Project Jupyter, and managed by NumFOCUS. The group was fêted at a
reception sponsored by Leidos. Participants traveled from all over the country
and volunteered their precious time and hard work to give this work to the Jupyter
community, with a heartfelt sense of gratitude to all the contributors to the
software projects we love and depend on. Thank you!
