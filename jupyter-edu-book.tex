This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use
anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation
\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The \textbf{bookdown} package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"bookdown"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{# or the development version}
\CommentTok{# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter
is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to
install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX):

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

Project Jupyter is a broad collaboration that develops open-source tools
for interactive and exploratory computing. The tools include: IPython,
the Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Hub, and an ecosystem of extensions
contributed by a large community. Jupyter Notebook exploded in
popularity since late 2014, fueled by its adoption as the favorite
environment for doing data science. It has also grown as a platform to
use in the classroom, to develop teaching materials, to share lessons
and tutorials, and more. Notebooks are documents containing text
narratives, combined with executable code (many languages are supported)
and the output of that code. This marriage of content and code makes for
a powerful new form of data-based communication. Educators everywhere
are adopting Jupyter for teaching.

This handbook is for any educator teaching a topic that includes data
analysis or computation to support the learning---not just courses in
engineering or science, but also data journalism, business and
quantitative economics, data-based decision sciences and policy,
quantitative health sciences, and others. It aims to give an entry
point, and a broad overview of Jupyter in education. Whether you are
already using Jupyter to teach, you have found learning materials built
on Jupyter that piqued your curiosity, or have never heard of Jupyter,
the material in this open book can help you empower your teaching with
this new technology.

Educators newly adopting Jupyter can be overwhelmed by having to
navigate the ecosystem of tools and content. They could study many
examples, or consume myriad blog posts and talk videos to distill the
patterns of good practices and technical solutions to best serve their
students. Several early adopters, having much experience to share,
decided to begin collecting this know-how, and sharing open
documentation about using Jupyter for teaching and learning.

The Jupyter Community Workshop in DC (November 2018) began that process,
with a book sprint aimed at producing the first version of this
handbook. The collaboratively written book consolidates explanations and
examples covering key topics, including: what is Jupyter, how to try
Jupyter, sharing notebooks with students, locally installing Jupyter,
cloud offerings, finding example notebooks, writing lessons in Jupyter,
making collections for a course, exporting to other formats with
nbconvert, writing textbooks with Jupyter, using Binder, JupyterHub,
making assignments and auto-grading, making online courses, teaching
with Jupyter in the classroom, active learning and flipped learning
pedagogies with Jupyter, guiding learners to create their own content in
Jupyter, and more. This open handbook will grow to encompass all you
need to know about Jupyter in Teaching and Learning.

If you find these materials helpful or inspiring, give us a shout-out on
Twitter using \#Jupyter4Edu. We hope you do!

The book sprint was held at the George Washington University in
Washington, DC, on 28--30 November 2018, and organized by Lorena A.
Barba. Funding to support the logistics and travel of all participants
was possible thanks to a grant from Bloomberg to Project Jupyter, and
managed by NumFOCUS. The group was fÃªted at a reception sponsored by
Leidos. Participants traveled from all over the country and volunteered
their precious time and hard work to give this work to the Jupyter
community, with a heartfelt sense of gratitude to all the contributors
to the software projects we love and depend on. Thank you!

\chapter{Glossary}\label{glossary}

\textbf{Anaconda}: a free, open-source package manager, environment
manager, Python distribution, and collection of
\href{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/}{over 1,500+
open source packages} including and also Jupyter.
\url{https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/}

\textbf{API (Application Programming Interface)}: the exact details of
interacting with software, usually used by other software.

\textbf{Binder}: a hosted service that allows anyone to launch their own
sandboxed notebook environment from a Git repository.
\url{https://mybinder.org}

\textbf{cell}: the area in a Jupyter Notebook where you can enter
markdown, or computer code.

\textbf{cloud, in the}: used to describe software or documents hosted on
a remote computer accessed over the internet.

\textbf{CSV (Comma Separated Values)}: referring to a comma-separated
value file. A plain-text file format such that each line is a list of
data separated by commas.

\textbf{execute}: technical term for having the computer perform the
instructions of your program. Alias for ``run it.''

\textbf{extension, Jupyter}: in this instance, it is not a request for
more time. Rather, a Jupyter extension is a bit of code, often developed
by a third-party, that adds additional functionality to Jupyter. For
example, a popular extension is a Table of Contents creator.

\textbf{flipped classroom}: a teaching style where students work on
their own outside of class to learn new material (sometimes by watching
recorded lectures or reading descriptive/interactive notebooks) and the
come together in the classroom to practice what they've learned through
exercises or experiments.

\textbf{Git}: a popular version control system (VCS) used for keeping
track of changes of files over time.

\textbf{IDE (Integrated Development Environment)}: software that assists
in the development of additional software.

\textbf{Jupyter}: The term ``Jupyter'' may refer to one of a couple of
different things: a community of users and developers focused on the
open source software; the collection of tools and standards that,
together, allow projects like the Jupyter Notebook to operate. The name
refers to the three core programming languages supported: Julia, Python,
and R.

\textbf{JupyterHub}: a cloud service that can provide access to Jupyter
notebooks and environments to multiple users via a modern web browser.
\url{http://jupyter.org/hub}

\textbf{kernel}: In Jupyter, a kernel is the packaging up of a language,
and related programs needed to run it. For example, Python2 and Python3
are separate kernels.

\textbf{LMS (Learning Management System)}: a cloud service that helps
instructors manage aspects of classrooms.

\textbf{load}: how many students can a computer support?

\textbf{Markdown}: a text format that allows for basic formatting
(headers, text styles, links) mixed inline with the text. Markdown files
usually have the extension \texttt{.md} and can be rendered natively by
GitHub and other tools.

\textbf{magic}: a meta-command typically starting with one or two
percent signs. Changes the meaning of the contents of a line (one
percent sign, \texttt{\%}) or the cell (two percent signs,
\texttt{\%\%}) from code to a particular meta-instruction. For example,
