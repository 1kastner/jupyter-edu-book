\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

Project Jupyter is a broad collaboration that develops open-source tools
for interactive and exploratory computing. The tools include: IPython,
the Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Hub, and an ecosystem of extensions
contributed by a large community. Jupyter Notebook exploded in
popularity since late 2014, fueled by its adoption as the favorite
environment for doing data science. It has also grown as a platform to
use in the classroom, to develop teaching materials, to share lessons
and tutorials, and more. Notebooks are documents containing text
narratives, combined with executable code (many languages are supported)
and the output of that code. This marriage of content and code makes for
a powerful new form of data-based communication. Educators everywhere
are adopting Jupyter for teaching.

This handbook is for any educator teaching a topic that includes data
analysis or computation to support the learning---not just courses in
engineering or science, but also data journalism, business and
quantitative economics, data-based decision sciences and policy,
quantitative health sciences, and others. It aims to give an entry
point, and a broad overview of Jupyter in education. Whether you are
already using Jupyter to teach, you have found learning materials built
on Jupyter that piqued your curiosity, or have never heard of Jupyter,
the material in this open book can help you empower your teaching with
this new technology.

Educators newly adopting Jupyter can be overwhelmed by having to
navigate the ecosystem of tools and content. They could study many
examples, or consume myriad blog posts and talk videos to distill the
patterns of good practices and technical solutions to best serve their
students. Several early adopters, having much experience to share,
decided to begin collecting this know-how, and sharing open
documentation about using Jupyter for teaching and learning.

The Jupyter Community Workshop in DC (November 2018) began that process,
with a book sprint aimed at producing the first version of this
handbook. The collaboratively written book consolidates explanations and
examples covering key topics, including: what is Jupyter, how to try
Jupyter, sharing notebooks with students, locally installing Jupyter,
cloud offerings, finding example notebooks, writing lessons in Jupyter,
making collections for a course, exporting to other formats with
nbconvert, writing textbooks with Jupyter, using Binder, JupyterHub,
making assignments and auto-grading, making online courses, teaching
with Jupyter in the classroom, active learning and flipped learning
pedagogies with Jupyter, guiding learners to create their own content in
Jupyter, and more. This open handbook will grow to encompass all you
need to know about Jupyter in Teaching and Learning.

If you find these materials helpful or inspiring, give us a shout-out on
Twitter using \#Jupyter4Edu. We hope you do!

\chapter{Getting Your Class Going with Jupyter}\label{getting-going}

You have several options on how to get Jupyter Notebooks to your
students. You can ask students to install Jupyter on their own
computers, install Jupyter on lab computers for students to use, or run
Jupyter on a remote server that your students access on the internet.

\section{Local installation on students' or lab
computers}\label{local-installation-on-students-or-lab-computers}

``Local installation'' means that each computer is running the software
that includes the Jupyter Notebook. Typically, this requires installing
a distribution that includes Jupyter, Python, and possibly other
language kernels.

A popular distribution for Jupyter is Anaconda, which is easy to install
on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Because it can install everything at the
user level, it does not require the installer to have administrator (or
root) permissions.

Two other popular open source projects that can run Jupyter notebooks
are \href{https://nteract.io/}{nteract} and
\href{https://nteract.io/atom}{Hydrogen}. nteract is installed by
downloading a binary installer from their website and double-clicking
the installation file. Once nteract is installed, any Jupyter notebook
on a student's local system can be double-clicked and it will open
within nteract. nteract's simple user interface make it an excellent
choice for students new to computer programming. Hydrogen is a
\href{https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen}{very popular plugin} for the
open source Atom editor; it's currently used by over 700,000 people.
Hydrogen lets a user edit, display, and execute a notebook within the
Atom editor.

You can ask students to install Jupyter on their own computer or make it
possible for them to use lab computers. These can also be combined: give
students the instructions to install it on their own, but also tell them
that it's available in the lab if they can't get it to work on their
laptop. This way you don't need a large enough computer lab for
everyone, and don't need to worry that not everyone can get it to work
on their own.

\subsection{Jupyter on student-owned
computers}\label{jupyter-on-student-owned-computers}

The benefits of installation on student-owned computers include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once students have the software on their computers, they always have
  access to it; they can work anywhere, and they can use it for
  internships, jobs, and other non-school activities.
\item
  It is easy for them to install additional packages later.
\item
  Students learn to install and set up Jupyter, and software in general,
  which is a skill they are likely to need.
\item
  The total computing power for the class scales with the number of
  students, as long as each student has enough CPU power and memory to
  support the intended applications.
\item
  You can adopt Jupyter without support or resources from your
  institution.
\item
  Students learn to use Jupyter on their preferred OS, e.g.~Linux, Mac,
  or Windows, which means they are already familiar with the basic
  idioms of their OS.
\end{itemize}

Drawbacks include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This approach is only possible if every student owns a computer with
  enough capacity.
\item
  Students with less powerful computers might be at an unfair
  disadvantage.
\item
  Although installation is generally easy, it still takes time. The time
  you spend at the beginning of a class can be worthwhile for a
  semester-long course that uses Jupyter throughout, but it is a barrier
  to using Jupyter for a single module or one-off assignment in a course
  about something else.
\item
  Also, the amount of time spent debugging esoteric problems scales with
  the number of students: a class of 25 students is bound to have a few
  people with 32-bit processors, incompatible libraries, out-of-date
  operating systems, over-zealous virus checkers, etc., and a class with
  100 students will have four times as many. One work-around is to have
  students work in pairs: the probability that more than half of the
  students cannot get it working is reduced.
\item
  Discrepancies in installed library versions can cause issues for
  students and may lead to different behaviors when students run code.
\end{itemize}

Although Jupyter is cross-platform and ideally behaves the same on
Windows, Mac, or Linux, and distributions such as Anaconda also behave
very similarly on all platforms, the instructions for installing and
launching it are slightly different on each operating system, so
fine-grained instructions such as ``double click here'' or ``type this
command'' need different versions for Linux, Mac, and Windows users,
which can be challenging when the instructor presenting the material has
only one platform at their disposal. It is worth developing detailed
instructions that the students can go through at their own pace, rather
than relying only on a live demo in class that will only apply to a
fraction of the students.

\subsection{Jupyter on lab computers}\label{jupyter-on-lab-computers}

Using lab computers instead of student-owned computers has the benefits
of uniformity and improved equity. Each student will have exactly the
same setup, and the instructions will work the same for everyone. This
reduces the amount of individual tech support required and guarantees
that all students have access to enough computational power.

However, this deployment has some disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Depending on how much control you have of the computer lab, you might
  need institutional permission and support.
\item
  Students might be limited to working on assignments only when they are
  on campus and when computer labs are open, which might be an unfair
  disadvantage for non-resident students or those with full time jobs.
\item
  It might be difficult to install additional packages as the need
  arises, and students might not be allowed to install packages they
  need for projects.
\item
  Even in a computer lab, it can be difficult to maintain consistency
  across machines, and to keep all installations functional.

  \textbf{--- Box}

  What is Anaconda? You will see the Anaconda distribution recommended
  by many educators and course authors. Anaconda is a package manager,
  an environment manager, a Python distribution, a collection of
  \href{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/}{over
  1,500+ open source packages}, and also Jupyter. It is free to
  download, open source, and easy to install, on any computer system
  (Windows, Mac OS X or Linux). It also includes the conda packaging
  utility to update and install new packages of the Python and R
  ecosystems, and to manage computational environments. According to the
  company's webpage, Anaconda has more than 6 million users.
  \url{https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/} . The Software
  Carpentry project provides installation instructions with videos for
  anaconda:
  \url{https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/}

  \textbf{--- Box}

  Two other popular open source projects that can run Jupyter notebooks
  are \href{https://nteract.io/}{nteract} and
  \href{https://nteract.io/atom}{Hydrogen}. nteract is installed by
  downloading a binary installer from their website and double-clicking
  the installation file. Once nteract is installed, any Jupyter notebook
  on a student's local system can be double-clicked and it will open
  within nteract. nteract's simple user interface make it an excellent
  choice for students new to computer programming. Hydrogen is a
  \href{https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen}{very popular plugin} for the
  open source Atom editor; it's currently used by over 700,000 people.
  Hydrogen lets a user edit, display, and execute a notebook within the
  Atom editor.
\end{itemize}

\section{Jupyter on remote servers}\label{jupyter-on-remote-servers}

Even when Jupyter runs locally, it runs as a web application; that is,
it runs in a browser connected to a server. In a local installation, the
browser and the server run on the same machine. But it is also possible
to run the server remotely.

In that case, students don't have to install anything; they only have to
run a browser and load a URL.

There are several ways to run Jupyter on a remote server:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  You can run Jupyter on a server owned by you or your institution.
\item
  You can run Jupyter in a temporary environment running in the cloud.
\item
  You can run Jupyter in a persistent environment running in the cloud.
\end{enumerate}

Running Jupyter remotely has many of the advantages of running in a lab:
you can provide a consistent environment and guarantee that all students
have access to sufficient computation resources. And it mitigates one of
the drawbacks of a lab installation, since students have access to cloud
resources from anywhere, not just on campus.

Working in the cloud also means that students do not have to manage
their own backups of a laptop hard drive. Although a student could still
inadvertently overwrite, delete, or destroy the contents of a notebook
stored in the cloud, they will not lose their entire work if a laptop is
damaged or lost.

For simple, one-off uses of Jupyter (say, for a single assignment or
in-class activity) the cloud option is very attractive as it requires
little in-class time to discuss installation of additional software.

\subsection{Running in a temporary environment in the
cloud}\label{running-in-a-temporary-environment-in-the-cloud}

The easiest option for running Jupyter in the cloud is to use a cloud
service that provides temporary environments. Some of these services are
free of cost, and you can use them without installing anything.

These environments are well-suited for short examples in classes that do
not use Jupyter extensively. Students can open a notebook and start
running with the push of a button.

However, there are some limitations to these services:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If your notebooks depend on particular packages, or particular
  versions of packages, it can be difficult to satisfy these
  requirements.
\item
  These services run notebooks in a temporary environment that
  disappears if it is left idle. So they might not be suitable for
  managing student work.
\item
  Some of these services do not guarantee a level of service and may not
  be as reliable as you need for a class or workshop.

  \textbf{--- Box}

  \textbf{Binder} (\href{https://mybinder.org}{mybinder.org}) is an
  open-source service provided by Project Jupyter. It allows the owner
  of a set of notebooks residing in a git repository to pre-build an
  image in the Binder service, and get a shareable link that any visitor
  can click to obtain a working instance of JupyterHub, with the
  notebooks in the repository. The session is temporary (any changes the
  user makes will be deleted when closing the tab or window), but it's
  fully interactive. Binder is currently one of the favorite services
  for running one-off workshops or tutorials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running on servers you
control}\label{running-on-servers-you-control}

If you have access to a server or cluster with enough computing power to
support your class---including CPU and especially memory---you can
provide a Jupyter as a service using JupyterHub.

JupyterHub is open-source software that provides a cloud-based Jupyter
application for each user in a group. Each user has their own account
and home directory on the server. The Hub, JupyterHub's central system,
allows authenticating users and starting individual Jupyter notebook
servers. Programs that start notebook servers can use a variety of
technical solutions. For more details, see
\url{https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Spawners}

Once the Hub starts a user's notebook server, the Jupyter Notebook
running in the cloud behaves just like Jupyter does when installed on an
individual's computer, but JupyterHub will be running notebooks and
storing files on a remote cloud computer. Students can download
notebooks stored in the cloud to their local computer if they wish to
work with a local installation as well. Additionally, students can
upload notebooks (and other files) from their local computer to the
cloud.

While anyone can run a JupyterHub server on their own Linux or Mac
computer, installing and configuring JupyterHub requires sophisticated
knowledge spanning the Linux/Unix operating system, system
administration, and networking. For more information, see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \url{https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub} (the basic JupyterHub
  project, which can be installed on a bare-metal server, a virtual
  private server (VPS), or a commercial cloud cluster)
\item
  \url{https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub} (a
  simplified installation of JupyterHub on a remote server or VPS)
\item
  \url{https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s} (a
  step-by-step guide to install JupyterHub on a Kubernetes cloud system)
\end{itemize}

Providing a JupyterHub service offers several benefits. First, students
get up and running immediately---they spend no time installing software.
They navigate to a web URL, log in to JupyterHub, and begin using
Jupyter. This ability to quickly log in and begin computing is a
powerful way to get students to engage with the lesson, builds
confidence, and avoids the sometimes-stressful experience of installing
software on the student's computer.

However, running JupyterHub on your own server has drawbacks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Getting started is not easy; most instructors would require (or at
  least benefit from) institutional support that may not be available.
\item
  It can be difficult to scale: if the number of students increases, you
  might need more computing power. And the load students generate can be
  uneven; for example, if everyone runs a computationally-intensive
  example at the same time, your server might not be able to handle it.
\item
  This option can be expensive, unless you already have servers with
  sufficient power.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running Jupyter in the
cloud}\label{running-jupyter-in-the-cloud}

If you or your institution don't own computing hardware with the power
to support your class, you can run JupyterHub on virtual servers
provided by cloud services like AWS and Microsoft Azure. In those
environment, you can install JupyterHub as described in the previous
section

Commercial offerings also exist to use Jupyter in the cloud, some of
which provide free trials or a ``freemium'' pricing model. They include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  CoCalc, previously MathSageCloud (\url{https://cocalc.com}) is a
  subscription service with a free trial plan. The service also includes
  the ability to share files with project collaborators. The no-cost
  version does not allow network access. This has some important
  limitations (for example, you cannot install additional packages or
  kernels).
\item
  Gryd (\url{https://gryd.us}) is another subscription service with a
  free tier. It includes course-management features, like a way to
  create a course, invite students, and deploy auto-graded assignments.
\item
  codio (\url{https://codio.com/features/ide})
\item
  Microsoft Azure notebooks (\url{https://notebooks.azure.com/} )
\item
  Amazon Sagemaker
  (\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-prepare.html})
\item
  Gradient by Paperspace (\url{https://www.paperspace.com/gradient})
\item
  Google Colaboratory (\url{https://colab.research.google.com/} )
\end{itemize}

The biggest advantage of these services is that they require no
installation and minimal setup by instructors, and some of them provide
features that integrate with learning management systems. However,
instructors generally have to create student accounts and set up student
environments.

These services are highly scalable; that is, they can handle large
numbers of students and uneven loads. However, they are not infallible;
they might require some tending to make sure students have access to
enough resources.

The biggest drawback of these services is that they can be expensive.
Some charge on a per-student basis, with limits on computation and
memory use. Some charge on the basis of actual use, which can be
unpredictable (and might require instructors to enforce limits on
student activities).

Other drawbacks include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It may be difficult or impossible to install packages you, or
  particular versions of packages.
\item
  Some of these services impose limits on what students can do; for
  example, they might have limited ability to access external services.
\item
  Many of these services are relatively new, and they sometimes expose
  instructors and students to rough edges.
\item
  Students generally lose access to their accounts when the class ends
  (or a limited time after).
\item
  There may be privacy concerns with sharing student information on
  commercial servers. Some institutions have agreements with one or more
  of these providers that address privacy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Distribution and Collection of
Materials}\label{distribution-and-collection-of-materials}

You may want to distribute course materials to and collect them from
students. A variety of options are available. Some important things to
consider:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you want to share your notebooks publicly, or do they require
  privacy?
\item
  Can the notebooks that the students create or edit be public? Or do
  they require privacy?
\item
  How do you plan to assess collected notebooks?
\item
  Do you need integration with your LMS?
\item
  Do you need integration with a file-sharing system?
\item
  Do you want to distribute with the cell output showing?
\item
  Do students need software that is not easily available on their own
  (or laboratory) computers?
\end{itemize}

Jupyter notebooks are plain text computer files, so you can distribute
them to students and collect them using any system that handles text
files, including GitHub, Google Drive, and (as a last resort) email.

\subsection{Learning Management
Systems}\label{learning-management-systems}

Many instructors use a Learning Management System (LMS) to communicate
with students. These tools offer private file sharing and assignments
that connect to the students' institutional computing accounts and they
can be used to distribute and collect notebooks as text files. However,
most LMS tools are not yet notebook-aware, so they don't render
notebooks or make it easy for instructors to comment on or grade them.

Some tools and workflows are being actively developed to connect the
Jupyter ecosystem to the LMS ecosystem using the
\href{https://open.edx.org/learning-tools-interoperability}{Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)} standard. By the time you read this, you
might find that the options have improved.

\subsection{Web hosting}\label{web-hosting}

Notebooks can be publicly hosted on any website, so students can
download the files by clicking on a link. Most web hosting software is
not notebook-aware, but nbviewer is a web service that renders notebooks
(\url{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/}). Also, some browser extensions can
open notebook files via nbviewer
(\url{https://github.com/jiffyclub/open-in-nbviewer}).

GitHub Pages (and other similar services) can be used to host rendered
notebooks, and continuous integration services can build the web pages
from the notebooks and then display content. See Jupyter Book
(\url{https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-book}) and use of
\href{https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr}{doctr} to do this.

\subsection{Git}\label{git}

One of the most popular tools for distributing and collecting notebooks
is Git, which is a version control system. Files under Git control are
often hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Many of
these services are notebook-aware; for example, when you view a notebook
on GitHub, you see a rendered notebook that includes formatted text,
typeset mathematics, code highlighting, and the output of the code,
including figures.

Educators at academic institutions can use GitHub Classroom, which
allows instructors to set up assignments for a class. Students click on
a link for an assignment and a copy of the assignment repo is created
and initialized with the assignment content, which can be a notebook.
Each student's repository can be made private, with access only granted
for the student and instructor. This can be an efficient way to
distribute assignments to a large class.

A drawback of Git is that it is hard to use. It might be worth spending
time in your class to teach Git if it is valuable for students to learn
about version control. But if this is not one of the learning goals for
your class, you can minimize the students' exposure to Git using
graphical interfaces like GitHub Desktop and Git for Windows.

The default Git tools for comparing files and merging changes do not
work well with Jupyter notebooks. However, there are specialized tools
to help with these tasks (see Notebooks Under Version Control).

\subsection{JupyterHub}\label{jupyterhub}

If your students are using JupyterHub, you can place notebooks and any
related files directly into the students' directories manually or via a
script. If nbgrader is available on your JupyterHub instance you can use
it to collect and distribute notebooks (whether or not you choose to use
nbgrader's assessment features). This allows you to develop the
notebooks and incrementally make them visible to the students for them
to ``fetch''. They can then edit the notebooks or create new ones in the
directory created in their storage space, and then publish their
notebooks back to you for downloading, viewing, or assessing with the
nbgrader tools (see the next section for details on this tool).

\begin{verbatim}
**â Box**


**What is nbgrader?** `nbgrader` is a tool for creating, handling, and automatically grading assignments based on Jupyter notebooks. It works as a Jupyter extension that the course creator installs on their computer. `nbgrader` is a flexible project in the Jupyter ecosystem that allows the distribution and collection of materials. As its name implies, it also can grade assignments; it can be used in a distributed manner where each student is running Jupyter on their own computers, or in a centralized manner, for example, if the students each have an account on a JupyterHub installation. (More details in the Assessment section.) <https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Using an LMS and nbgrader
together:}\label{using-an-lms-and-nbgrader-together}

Integration of nbgrader with learning management systems is still
primitive, but the following is a strategy that works with current
tools.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The instructor creates an assignment notebook using nbgrader, then
  distributes the assignment to students via an LMS.
\item
  Students complete the assignment and upload the solution to the LMS.
\item
  The instructor downloads the completed assignments as zip file and
  extracts the students' solutions in a Jupyter environment.
\item
  Instructors and graders use nbgrader to grade the assignment and save
  the grades to a CSV file.
\item
  The CSV file is then uploaded to the LMS.
\end{enumerate}

There are already some tools that make this workflow easier, including
the Extractor plugin to the ZipCollect feature in nbgrader
(\url{https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/zipcollect-plugin.html}).

\section{Assessing student learning with Jupyter
Notebooks}\label{assessing-student-learning-with-jupyter-notebooks}

Many educators develop course-assessment activities as Jupyter
Notebooks. This includes exams, in-class activities, homework
assignments, and projects.

One simple way to handle the assessment of a notebook-based submission
is to have students either print them out, email them, submit them as a
standard electronic document (say into a Course Management System), or
drop them into a shared folder. At that point, the instructor can mark
and grade them in a traditional manner, for example by simply writing
comments on a printout or adding annotations to a PDF.

\begin{verbatim}
**_Pro Tip: Printing out a notebook can sometimes result in wasted space on pages, especially for notebooks with many images or figures. Converting to PDF requires large/complex LaTeX installations. Exporting to HTML and then printing often gives a better result._**
\end{verbatim}

nbgrader allows code cells in a notebook to be marked to be auto-graded
or manually graded. An instructor can then create an assignment that can
be completely auo-graded, requiring little work after the notebook has
been created. This makes grading much easier and scales well with large
class sizes. However, creating such an auto-graded notebook in nbgrader
can be quite time-consuming. In addition, pedagogically a completely
auto-graded notebook may have serious downsides. For example, studies
suggest that students learn better when they can actively connect a
topic to their own interests {[}CITATION NEEDED{]}. One method of
encouraging this is to have a ``reflection'' question on each
submission. Such a reflection question can encourage students to comment
on the material in a personal way, but it cannot be auto-graded. Another
downside is that simply autograding code with unit tests is unlikely to
assess many of the learning objectives you might have for an assignment,
e.g., ability to use specific software-design patterns. To address this,
you can create manually graded cells for a portion of an assignment and
provide written feedback to the student.

\emph{GOTCHA: At the time of this writing, nbgrader has some limitations
that require careful use. For example, using it in a multi-class setting
(say, on JupyterHub) requires that instructors coordinate the naming of
assignments so that they do not collide.}

nbgrader is a sophisticated tool that can be set up to allow multiple
graders, teaching assistants, and more. For more information on using
nbgrader, see \url{https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader}.

There are some third-party notebook-based assessment solutions. For
example CoCalc (\textless{}www.cocalc.com\textgreater{}) and Vocareum
(\textless{}www.vocareum.com\textgreater{}) provide a cloud notebook
platform that can also perform assessment similar to nbgrader.

\_For example, cocalc.com offers\ldots{} {[}are there other third-party
course management notebook-oriented solutions?{]} and Berkeley uses
DataHub for their large Data8 course. Vocareum

\section{How do you create Jupyter Notebooks for reuse and
sharing?}\label{how-do-you-create-jupyter-notebooks-for-reuse-and-sharing}

As you create notebooks for your lectures, computational essays, or
homework assignments, you may wish to think about how to make it
possible that they can be reused by yourself and others.

First, you may want to make the materials openly accessible and findable
via the internet. This suggests avoiding keeping the notebooks behind a
``walled garden,'' such as a Course Management System. That is, users
may have access to some material, but be prevented from seeing other
materials. You will have to decide whether you want others to have full
access. For example, many teachers do not want students to be able to
see notebooks that may have solutions, or hints of solutions and
therefore limit their access.

Callout box: To share your notebook with others you can submit it to
\url{https://www.engage-csedu.org/} This curated collection of open
educational computing resources is maintained by the National Center for
Women in Information Technology (NCWIT).

If you decide to make your notebooks reusable by others, make it clear
under which license the materials can be used. For example, you can
include a Creative Commons attribution and share-alike statement at the
bottom of your notebook. Adding a license allows people to reuse your
materials without asking for permission explicitly.
\url{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/}

GitHub may be the most common service to host and share notebooks, where
they can be viewed (including rendering), downloaded, or forked by
others. (Private repositories can also be used to limit visibility to
colleagues, students, or other organizations.). Make sure to be aware of
some of the pitfalls of keeping notebooks version controlled however
(see Notebooks Under Version Control for details).

Another potential issue with sharing deals with external files that you
may want to include in your notebook. This is in contrast with content
(say a plot) that can be directly created by the notebook's code.
Possible content includes data, images and videos using code and
embedding tags in markdown or HTML. The implication is that if you share
your notebook you must include the external files along with the
notebook. This can be done a number of ways including using a version
control repository, a zip-file, or a file sharing service. Another
external dependency issue with sharing notebooks involves software
libraries. In this case you share a configuration file that a user can
use to setup the same environment. Examples of these files include a
conda env.yml, a pip requirements.txt, or dockerfile.

Because Jupyter notebooks embed the output of cells into the ipynb file
itself (e.g., images, videos, etc.), the files can grow large. To make
it possible to display the cell output via the renderers on Github,
Gitlab, or nbviewer, save the notebook after it is executed and then
upload to those services. If instead you want to reduce file size and
provide the notebooks to someone with the code cell output cleared,
choose this option in the notebook's dropdown interface. Then the user
will need to execute the notebook themselves to see the output.

\section{Jupyter: a 21st Century Genre of Open Educational Resources and
Practices}\label{jupyter-a-21st-century-genre-of-open-educational-resources-and-practices}

Educators create teaching and learning materials. With the appearance of
the internet, a community of educators began producing open access
traditional teaching materials. In parallel, a community of software
developers began creating open source software. Each community developed
their own development patterns. In particular open source software
communities gravitated to the bazaar style\footnote{The bazaar style is
  a method of collectively creating software that isn't top down
  directed like a traditional company hierarchy.} of distributed and
collaborative work. Jupyter notebooks may be the first time that these
communities are merging. Jupyter notebook authors are applying the
content creation patterns they use to the creation of open educational
resources that teach computation or teach through computation.

Open Education encompasses a large community, with its own conferences
and journals, with leaders and advocated practices. The most visible
efforts are related to Open Educational Resources (OER): the creation
and adoption of openly licensed learning materials. In 1994, Wayne
Hodgins coined the term ``learning object'' and the idea spread that
digital materials could be designed and made to be \emph{reused}. This
was followed by efforts to develop metadata standards, content
exchanges, and so on (addressing the concern of how to find the objects
to reuse them). In 1998, David Wiley coined the term ``open content''
and spread the idea that principles of Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) could be applied to content on the World Wide Web. The Creative
Commons non-profit organization was founded in 2001 to provide
ready-made license agreements for sharing content and served a vital
infrastructure role on the spread of OER. The Creative Commons licenses
are now the most widely used licensing framework for open education. The
year 2001 also saw the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW). MIT promised
free public access for non-commercial uses of their course materials. It
was a unique commitment at an institutional level, strengthened by the
MIT brand. Other universities joined the OCW movement: Rice with the
OpenStax project (now formerly Connexion), CMU with the Open Learning
Initiative (OLI), Utah State University with the Center for Open and
Sustainable Learning, and so on. Today, the Open Education Consortium
has hundreds of members from around the world. The recurrent topics in
OER are: reducing costs for students buying textbooks, increasing
access, and dealing with copyright and licenses.

In the last few years, educators using Jupyter have been creating and
sharing all kinds of educational materials in the form of notebooks,
typically under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY). In fact,
Jupyter is \emph{a new genre of OER}. But in addition to creating open
content, educators using Jupyter often take active part in the Jupyter
community and adopt the \emph{culture} of open-source software. This is
a culture with strong ethical commitments, related to freedom of access,
transparency, and governance (Coleman, 2012). The content they create
has the value of giving access (the very definition of OER), under an
open model. But open-source culture also promotes a culture of
collaboration. In this regard, engaging in teaching with Jupyter opens
new possibilities for educators to engage in \emph{open development} and
collaborate with others in producing lessons, tutorials, courses, and
even books.

\textbf{kernel}: In Jupyter, a kernel is the packaging up of a language,
and related programs needed to run it. For example, Python2 and Python3
are separate kernels.

\textbf{LMS (Learning Management System)}: a cloud service that helps
instructors manage aspects of classrooms.

\textbf{load}: how many students can a computer support?

\textbf{Markdown}: a text format that allows for basic formatting
(headers, text styles, links) mixed inline with the text. Markdown files
usually have the extension \texttt{.md} and can be rendered natively by
GitHub and other tools.

\textbf{magic}: a meta-command typically starting with one or two
percent signs. Changes the meaning of the contents of a line (one
percent sign, \texttt{\%}) or the cell (two percent signs,
\texttt{\%\%}) from code to a particular meta-instruction. For example,
\texttt{\%\%R} indicates that the cell contents will be interpreted as
commands to the R language. Magics are kernel-specific (e.g., vary with
the kernel in use).

\textbf{nbgrader}: a tool for creating, handling, and automatically
grading assignments based on Jupyter notebooks.

\textbf{nbviewer}: a web application for rendering Jupyter notebooks as
static web pages, providing a URL to share and view them with a modern
web browser. \url{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org}

\textbf{nbconvert}: a tool for converting Jupyter notebooks into other
formats such as PDF, HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, reStructuredText, and
others. \url{https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io}

\textbf{notebook hidden state}: a technical term referring to the value
of variables that may have surprising results due to cells having been
executed in a non-sequential order.

\textbf{open source}: software and documents that are created in a
manner that give you rights to be able to use, and reproduce.

\textbf{pattern}: A ``pattern'' is a technical term referring to an
abstract description of a labeled process. For example, ``wash, rinse,
repeat'' is a common pattern for cleaning various objects.

\textbf{service, JupyterHub}: JupyterHub can take advantage of
additional separate, but integrated, software extensions. These are
called ``services.''

\textbf{script}: a colloquial term for a computer program.

\textbf{unit test}: a technical term for a ``test'' for checking to see
