### Who is this for?

Faculty teaching any subject containing some data analyis or computation. We invite faculty in any school of the George Washington University, and other colleges or universities in the greater Washington area.

If you're teaching in science, engineering, journalism, policy or any field using data to inform decisions, you want to know about Jupyter!

This workshop will introduce you to Jupyter and the ecosystem of tools that have evolved around its use in education.

We'll start with a short, active tutorial session on using Jupyter notebooks, then we'll discuss topics like:

* How to write lessons as Jupyter notebooks
* How to publish those lessons (Figshare, Dropbox, GitHub)
* Converting notebooks to other formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
* How to share materials with students
* Options for cloud access to Jupyter
* Using notebooks in class: active learning with live coding
* Tools for making assignments
* Collaborating with other instructors in course development

We invite all participants to bring sample materials that they teach with and could be developed into Jupyter lessons. The four mentors will work with you to make sample lesson.
